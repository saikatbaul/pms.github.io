			About Us
		</h2>
		<p>
			sPharmacy is a leading manufacturer and exporter of medicines in Bangladesh. Incorporated in the late 90s, sPharmacy began as a distributor, importing products from global MNCs like Bayer, Germany and Upjohn, USA and selling them in the local market, which were later manufactured and distributed under licensing arrangement. Since then, the journey continued, and today, sPharmacy is one of the largest exporters of medicines in Bangladesh.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The company continues to adhere to the global standards and its manufacturing facilities have been already certified by the regulatory authorities of USA, Europe, Australia, Canada, Latin America and South Africa. Over the last three decades sPharmacy has grown from strength to strength but the simple principle on which it was founded remains the same: producing high quality generics and making them affordable. Ensuring access to quality medicines is the powerful aspiration that motivates more than 4,700 employees of the company, and each of them is guided by the same moral and social responsibilities the company values most.

		<p>
			We always strive to provide better access to quality and affordable medicines because we know good health is priceless.
